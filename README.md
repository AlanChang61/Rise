# Rise

# App definition statement  
    Rise is a mobile application that strives to simplify and improve the user’s experience when 
    checking the weather. Apart from its modern and simple interface, Rise is set apart from other 
    mobile weather applications because of its ability to recommend clothing and its checklist 
    functionality. Through this app, users will be able easily access their everyday weather 
    information and get reminders for recommended clothing each day. 
    
# Why does it matter? 
    For many, getting those last few minutes of sleep in before work or school is well-needed; 
    However, when they have to get up and quickly get dressed, many will forget to check the weather 
    and plan what they will wear for the day. For this reason, Rise has the potential of appealing to 
    most people not only because it saves them time, but also because it protects them from the risk of 
    illness. 
 
    Being underdressed in unfavorable weather conditions can lead to potential illnesses such as the 
    common cold, pneumonia, and hypothermia. In addition, being unprepared for the weather can 
    result in an uncomfortable day due to soggy socks in the rain or thick sweaters in the heat. 

    Rise will help better inform people about the weather and recommend them proper attire for the 
    day in a convenient and reliable way. Since many people often forget to bring umbrellas on rainy 
    days or overdress on hot, summer days, Rise can help better prepare them for their day as soon as 
    they rise in the morning.
